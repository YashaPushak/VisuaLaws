VisuaLaws was designed anc reated by Kimberly Dextras-Romagnino and 
Yasha Pushak as part of a course project for CPSC 547: Information 
Visualization taken at UBC in 2015. The course project idea was
suggested by Knomos (http://knomos.ca/).

You can run VisuaLaws by loading index.html. This project was designed
for optimal performance in Chrome running on Windows 10. Other browsers
and operating systems are likely to cause some display problems.
If you want to load the largest act, load dragons.html file, but be 
warned this takes approximately 15 minutes to load, and will not work 
when it is done.

The main file to get everything running is index.html. From there, all 
of our javascript code is loaded from the scripts folder, and our 
stylesheet, style.css is loaded.
