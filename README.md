You can run VisuaLaws by loading index.html in Chrome, Otherbrowsers 
(and possible operating systems) may have some display problems.
If you want to load the largest act, load dragons.html file, but be 
warned this takes approximately 15 minutes to load, and will not work 
when it is done.

The main file to get everything running is index.html. From there, all 
of our javascript code is loaded from the scripts folder, and our 
stylesheet, style.css is loaded.  

Yasha wrote everything in the folder named Yasha, and Kim wrote everything
in the folder named Kim inside of the scripts folder. The External folder
contains the external libraries that we used for our project. Note, however,
that jquery-ui-extensions was heavily modified by Yasha to support the 
label positions for the dates on the timeline slider.
